## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was loads of fun and helped me learn/understand several things:

- Continued the mindset of first working on the HTML structure first and styling afterward
- Implemented a CSS reset file for the first time ðŸ™Œ
- Gained a better understanding of when to use CSS Grid VS. Flexbox
- Used semantic HTML structuring elements: main, article and footer
- Learned all about the HTML <picture> element and implemented into this project
- Also learned about the HTML <del> element, how to use it AND issues with accessibility that can be resolved with some CSS magic! ðŸª„

```html
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
    media="(min-width: 640px)"
  />
  <img
    src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Gabrielle Essence Parfum bottle laying down with leaves surrounding"
  />
</picture>

<del>
  <p>$169.99</p>
</del>
```

```css
del::before,
del::after {
  clip-path: inset(100%);
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}

del::before {
  content: " [deletion start] ";
}

del::after {
  content: " [deletion end] ";
}
```

### Continued development

- Continue working with CSS grid and Flexbox to understand how each work and when to use one VS. the other.

- Also continue to work on mobile-first workflow, remembering to start with the mobile viewport size(s) and work up from there.

### Useful resources

- [<picture>: The Picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - Excellent article from MDN explaining the use cases for the <picture> element and how it assists when using multiple images that display based on viewport size. Also explains fallbacks - where we can offer alternative image formats for cases where certain formats are not supported and how we can help to save bandwidth and improve page load times! A win-win!
- [<del>: The Deleted Text element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the <del> HTML element. I originally started the project by using CSS to line-through the text. I shortly realized that there was an HTML element that could do this without needing HTML and is better for accessability purposes.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you SO much to MDN for always coming in clutch on helping whenever I need explanations for any/everything! Oftentimes, questions arise while I'm coding and I know I can always count on MDN to fully explain down to the nitty gritty!

Also to Josh Comeau for the CSS reset instructions.
